# Weather Forecast
Website for recognizing the weather in a certain city, which involves the use of an API with validation and pleasant UI components.

### 🛢️ Requests to the server
Requests are made using the API, which I converted to JSON format using the `object.json()` method and then referring to JSON passed the data to HTML. A fairly easy and convenient way to transfer data from the API to the site itself.
> API - https://www.weatherapi.com/

### 🪜 Stages of the `weather` section
- Waiting for a request (The request has not loaded yet)
- Request received (stage with weather information)
- Incorrect city (The name of the city is entered incorrectly)

### 🗂️ Future plans for the site
- [ ] Delete the stage with the error about the incorrect name of the city and issue it as an error notification
- [ ] Make adaptive for mobile devices, etc.
- [ ] Rewrite the site to React

This was my first site that I decided to post on GitHub.

👋 Thanks for your attention!
